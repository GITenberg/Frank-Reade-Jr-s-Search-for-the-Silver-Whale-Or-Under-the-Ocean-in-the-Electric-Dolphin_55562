</div>

<p class='c012'>“A submarine boat? Do you really mean it, Frank? I
trust you are not becoming mentally unbalanced with the
success of your inventive efforts. Not content with the
Electric Air-ship, you now meditate the construction of
a submarine vessel.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is what I said, friend Stanhope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, pshaw, man! Do you realize what an impossible
feat that is?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I realize only that it is quite possible,” replied the young
inventor, imperturbably.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And you are really in earnest?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“As much as I ever was in my life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>George Stanhope, explorer and geologist, and a handsome,
well developed American, of forty years, of varied experiences,
sat quite still for a moment and studied the features
of his companion.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was Frank Reade, Jr., of Readestown, U. S. A.,
the most famous man in the inventive line of the present
generation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Despite his youth, he had brought to perfection some of
the most wonderful and gigantic of enterprises.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the moment the two men were sitting in the smoking
room of the Southern Hotel in New Orleans.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was while discussing various topics that the subject
of the submarine boat was broached.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once Stanhope was interested and incredulous.</p>

<p class='c000'>He listened to Frank’s theories for awhile, then began to
express his incredulity.</p>

<p class='c000'>And thus we find them arguing the matter at the opening
of our story.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You may be in earnest, Frank,” said the explorer, with
a laugh, “but I think you have tackled a pretty difficult subject.
Don’t you agree with me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is not so difficult to solve submarine navigation as
aerial flight,” he said; “there is enough in Nature to teach
us how the problem may be accomplished.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but it is impossible to always copy Nature.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet we may draw our plans from her liberal sources.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In what way has Nature assisted you in your plan of
submarine navigation?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She has given me a model.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A model?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“In the salt water there swims a fish called the bream,
or sunfish. He is at once the most buoyant and generally
agile of fish. He will furnish my model.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So you propose to model your boat after a fish?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not? All the necessary points may be obtained
from the fish. For instance, I shall have in my boat a system
of air reservoirs akin to the bladders of the fish, for the
purpose of arising or descending, as necessity may require.
Fins shall preserve the equilibrium, and a screw shall furnish
the motive power. What more do I want?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How will you live without oxygen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I shall have plenty of oxygen. I have already devised a
system of electric and chemical generators which destroy the
poisonous gases as readily as they create pure air. This
will enable a perfect circulation to be kept up aboard the
craft.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope drew a deep breath and knocked the ashes from
his cigar.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are too deep for me, Frank,” he said, sententiously.
“To use a slang phrase—I am not in it. I wish you success
in your emulation of Captain Nemo.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is possible that I may fail,” said the young inventor,
consulting his watch, “but I shall endeavor to win success.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope you may.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have now to leave to catch my train. I bid you goodbye.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope seized Frank’s hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I want to ask a favor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When you get ready to start your submarine boat will
you grant me permission to accompany you on the trial
trip?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have you considered the risk?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suppose it sinks and never rises?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pshaw!” exclaimed Stanhope; “do you think I am a
soft head? Have I braved the life of the deadly jungle and
the pestilential rivers of India to stand in fear of death in
such a manner? Have I your permission?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank shook the explorer’s hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly,” he said, warmly. “I shall be very glad of
your company. I am going home now to begin work on my
new venture. When it is completed I will wire you to
come.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That settles it!” cried Stanhope. “I will live in expectation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It may require many weeks to perfect the boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right. I will live in patience.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus the two men parted.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were kindred spirits though each was cast in a different
mold. The inventor and the explorer; how fitting
it was that they should affiliate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope proceeded at once to New York where he was
to fulfill a lecture course on Africa.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., went straight to Readestown, where
he at once closeted himself, and for several days was hardly
seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he emerged at length from his seclusion he had the
plans of his new invention all perfected.</p>

<p class='c000'>All that was necessary now was to construct the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>He a once conferred with his engineers and machinists.
The result was that a large gang of skilled workmen were
quickly engaged in the construction of the Dolphin, which
was the name Frank gave the craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>In some manner news of the projected boat leaked out,
and it became known all over the country that Frank
Reade, Jr., was about to present to the world the greatest
triumph of mechanical science ever known.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course the whole country was agog with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had scores of letters asking various privileges, all
of which of course he refused.</p>

<p class='c000'>The weeks passed by and progress on the Dolphin was
very rapid.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Frank’s employ were two peculiar characters. One
was a red-headed Irishman of the Tipperary type named
Barney O’Shea. The other was a comical darky of the old
plantation species named Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp and Barney were Frank Reade, Jr.’s most valued
servants.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had accompanied him on all his travels, shared
dangers, hardships and triumphs with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were deeply devoted to their handsome and accomplished
young master, and clung to him closely.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were delighted with the prospect of a deep-sea
cruise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, I’ll make love to the bootiful mermaids an’
hobnob wid Neptune himself, bad cess to him!” cried
Barney, gleefully. “Shure, it’ll be foine sport to go a-fishin’
for whales an’ porpuses down there, naygur.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” rejoined Pomp, as he threw a flip-flap, “I don’
fink yo’ want to fish much fo’ whales, sonny! Dey pull yo’
ober into de watah fo’ suah!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How the divil will they do that, yez black ape?” roared
Barney. “Don’t yez see that we’re undher wather anyway?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Mebbe dat whale swallow yo’, den.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, he cudn’t swally me an’ ther boat too, yez ignyramus!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp scratched his woolly head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wha’ dat yo’ call me, chile?” he asked. “Am I a lily
igglylamus? I done fink dat yo’ call me somefin’ else afo’
I get froo wif yo’. Ki dar!”</p>

<p class='c000'>And Pomp made a rush for his colleague. They closed in
a lively wrestle.</p>

<p class='c000'>While the warmest of friends, both were addicted to the
habit of practical joking. Each loved to play pranks upon
the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, yez haven’t got the sand to trow me off me
feet, naygur!” roared Barney, as they wrestled. “Whurroo!
Over yez go!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But as Pomp went down he brought Barney also, and thus
the unequal struggle went on.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was terminated finally by the appearance of Frank
Reade, Jr., on the scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally the last bolt was driven, the last rivet cut, and
the Dolphin floated in the waters of the big tank, completed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank sent a telegram to New York, worded thus:</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dear Stanhope</span>,—The Dolphin is finished. If you wish
to participate in the trial trip, report at once. Shall expect
you by Thursday sure. Please reply. Yours ever,</p>

</div>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>Promptly Stanhope appeared in Readestown Thursday of
that week. He went at once to the machine shops.</p>

<p class='c000'>He found Frank there awaiting him. They shook hands
warmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are on hand promptly,” said Frank, “but I think I
can give you a great surprise.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then the submarine boat is an accomplished fact?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am curious to see the great wonder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You shall have your wish gratified.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They left the office and went at once out into the yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank led the way to the tank, an immense affair with a
depth of forty feet, sufficient to float a war cruiser.</p>

<p class='c000'>This tank, or artificial pond, was connected with a deep
canal by a gate and locks.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing through the canal, the river could be reached in
a short while, and thence a course was open to the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the tank floated like a cork the beautiful triumph of a
mighty inventive genius, the submarine boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was truly a beautiful specimen of marine architecture,
though totally unlike the general run of sea craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were no sails or visible means of propulsion. No
high decks or bulwarks, but a hull wonderful in its symmetry.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was built much upon the lines of the salt
water bream, and was as buoyant and light as could be desired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope stood upon the edge of the tank for some while
regarding the new craft with interest and wonderment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank advanced and said briskly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, George, what do you think of it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The explorer was silent a moment; then he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It looks feasible from here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank laughed heartily.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You must come aboard,” he said, “and then I think
your doubts will forever be set at rest upon that point. Are
you quite ready?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes,” replied Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then follow me.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='II' class='c009'>CHAPTER II.<br /> <span class='large'>STANHOPE IS SATISFIED.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Frank Reade, Jr., led the way aboard the Dolphin without
further delay. A portable platform extended along the
side, which was provided with a handrail.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank explained this.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see this is provided with joints and hinges,” he
said. “When the boat gets into motion this is easily folded
up against the side of the boat, making the hull smooth,
so that it offers no resistance to swift passage through the
water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the hull was cut a door, which opened by pressure upon
an electric spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>Its existence might never have been suspected at a cursory
glance. The section of windows along each side were the
same.</p>

<p class='c000'>The body or hull of the Dolphin was composed of thin
plates of steel closely riveted together. They were tough
and capable of resisting a great pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The hull was especially constructed for descending to
great depths, where the pressure was liable to be very great.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stern of the Dolphin was shaped like the broad tail
of a fish. Beneath it was the rudder and screw propeller.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lateral fins served to keep the boat’s equilibrium.</p>

<p class='c000'>Forward were two huge bull’s-eye windows in which were
set powerful searchlights.</p>

<p class='c000'>In general this was a description of the exterior of the
Dolphin. They now passed into the interior.</p>

<p class='c000'>Passing through the door, which could be hermetically
sealed in an instant, if necessary, they stood in a sort of vestibule.</p>

<p class='c000'>A door led into the cabin. Here Frank paused and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is the vestibule. By its means one can leave the
boat while it is under water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Leave the boat while under water!” exclaimed Stanhope
in surprise. “How on earth can you do that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Easily enough,” replied Frank. “I have a diving suit
with a storage tank and a generator connected with the
helmet. By its means I can travel anywhere under water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A diving suit!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That will do. But how can you open the door to leave
the boat without flooding it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By means of this vestibule.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank placed his hands upon a stopcock; then he continued:</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you wish to leave the boat, you enter the vestibule
from the cabin, presuming that your diving suit is on. You
close the cabin door behind you, open this valve, the vestibule
fills with water. You open the outer door and walk
out. When, you wish to return, simply enter the vestibule,
close the outer door, then press this second valve. At once
the water is pumped out of the vestibule by pneumatic pressure.
When it is empty you may safely enter the cabin.
See the idea?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very simple,” agreed Stanhope; “but very ingenious.
Lead on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>They now passed into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was a literal revelation. The famous explorer gazed
upon the scene with the deepest of admiration.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am captivated!” he declared. “It exceeds my most
sanguine hopes. Frank, it is grand!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor was much pleased with this rhapsody.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thought you would like it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cabin was furnished with the elegance of a fashionable
salon. Expensive furnishing and draperies played their
part.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along the walls of the cabin extended the tubes of the
generator which supplied the boat with pure air while under
water.</p>

<p class='c000'>These and the generator were examined curiously by
Stanhope. Then they passed on into the living compartments
of the boat, and thence to the engine-room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here was all the delicate electric machinery which furnished
the motive power of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was carefully inspected, as well as the mechanism of
the reservoirs which regulated the descent and ascent of the
Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank led Stanhope to a neat little stateroom with
a luxurious couch and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“These are your quarters, George. I trust they will suit
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, I should say so!” cried the explorer. “You are too
kind to me, Frank. This will be the greatest treat of my
life.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now,” said Frank, “I will demonstrate to you that the
Dolphin is a submarine boat.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is all that is left to be done,” said Stanhope: “You
have verified everything else.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“When I have proved to you the ability of the boat to
travel under water, then will you be satisfied?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perfectly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank shouted to Barney, who was forward in the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ay, sor!” replied the Celt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Press valve No. ten, and switch off lever No. six.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Valve ten will hermetically seal every door and window,”
explained Frank; “then lever six will open the sinking
reservoir and we will go down.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you are at all doubtful of the result, you shall witness
the trial from the shore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never!” cried Stanhope, forcibly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right, George.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the light in the cabin faded. There was a
sinking sensation and all was deep gloom.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Press key four, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt obeyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly there was a flood of light in the cabin. Electric
globes blazed in various quarters, and illumined the
bottom of the tank as the boat reached it.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a gentle shock, and then the window shutters
slid back. A fine view of the bed of the tank was had.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope gazed upon the spectacle with interest and wonderment.</p>

<p class='c000'>He breathed as freely and regularly as ever, and the chemical
air of the boat seemed fully as good as that of the upper
part of the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>For fully half an hour the boat remained at the bottom
of the tank. The generators were a complete success.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Stanhope said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am satisfied, Frank, that one could live indefinitely
under water with your generator.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad of that,” said Frank. “Now I will prove to
you that the Dolphin can travel under water.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This time Frank stepped into the pilot-house, and took
the wheel. He pressed a key, which set the propellers in
motion. Then the Dolphin glided forward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Round and round the tank went the submarine boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope’s last doubt was removed. He caught Frank’s
hands and wrung them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Enough!” he cried. “The submarine boat is a success.
It will be the wonder of the world. Let us be off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“For the ocean?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But,” said Frank, thoughtfully, “we ought to have some
object in view.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have one.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come with me and I will tell you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin had returned to the surface and lay along
the side of the tank. Stanhope led the way from the boat
and thence to the office.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he threw himself into a chair which was drawn up
to a table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank seated himself opposite.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope drew some papers from his pocket. He spread
them out.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will see that this is a chart of the Pacific,” he said.
“Here is a point westward from the Aleutian Isles which
I have marked.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank noted this.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now,” continued the great explorer, “I have a very
strange story to tell you of this part of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The story was given me by Captain Barclay, of the
brig Helen, of San Francisco. It sounds like a fairy story.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The Helen had left Calcutta six months previous and
was in these waters through force of circumstances, having
been blown thither by a terrific hurricane of a week’s duration.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This had brought them into sealing waters. As the brig
had run short of provisions, Captain Barclay decided to kill
some seals for meat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Accordingly the boat was ordered out. The seals
were quite plentiful, and it was easy to shoot them in the
water, and by quick work secure them before they should
sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The boat’s crew were thus engaged when suddenly a
thrilling thing occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a catastrophe wholly unlooked for and resulted
most seriously for at least one member of the crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This was Albert Tucker, the first mate, who was thrown
far from the boat by a sudden shock. Some heavy body
struck the boat and smashed it. In an instant the crew
were struggling in the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All but Tucker succeeded in getting upon the overturned
long boat, and were rescued later by a relief party from the
ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Tucker’s fate was fearful. He was struggling in the
water one hundred yards to leeward, and every man on the
wrecked boat could see him, when an immense white body
rose from the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a tremendous whale of the very rare silver or
white species. It rose close to the swimming man. We saw
its huge mouth open, and then—Tucker disappeared from
view.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Now, the white or silver whale, so called, is really a tremendous
species of shark.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course all knew that Tucker had been swallowed by
the monster. They feared for themselves, but the creature
did not venture to attack them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had listened to the narrative with interest, but he
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is a thrilling story. But how can we do Tucker
any good now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We cannot, of course,” replied the explorer. “But I
have not told you all yet. There is an under plot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You see, Tucker was no ordinary man. A year previous
he and his brother Valentine were prosperous in business
in San Francisco. One day, Valentine had trouble with a
bookkeeper in his employ and discharged him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Albert was a bachelor, but Valentine had a family, a
happy wife and small children.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The bookkeeper, Alden Vance, had threatened Valentine’s
life, and the fact was well known that the feeling between
them was not of the pleasantest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Vance was extremely dissipated, and had for a crony
a low-browed ex-gambler, Duncan Crane. Thus matters
stood when San Francisco one day was startled with a fearful
horror.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Valentine Tucker, going home from his business late
one night, heard an awful cry of human agony from a narrow
street near by.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='III' class='c009'>CHAPTER III.<br /> <span class='large'>THE VOYAGE BEGUN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Valentine Tucker was a man of impulse and never
hesitated when he knew that a fellow being was in distress.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He rushed into the street in time to see one man fall
and another skurry away in the gloom.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Feeling sure of foul play he knelt over the prostrate
man and felt for his heart, as he did so his hand closed upon
the handle of a dagger.</p>

<p class='c000'>“With a sense of horror, not knowing what he did, he
pulled it from the wound. The red blood dyed his sleeve
and arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Before he could rise to his feet and sound an alarm,
lights flashed about him and he was in the grip of officers of
the law.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Caught thus apparently red-handed, the crime was fastened
upon him. There seemed no way for him to prove his
innocence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Furthermore, the fact that the dead man was Alden
Vance was decidedly against him. He was thrown into
prison, tried and convicted of murder.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was an awful fatality. At once the business so prosperous
declined, and Albert was forced to retire at a heavy
loss. But he was faithful to his brother.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He avowed his intention of proving his brother’s innocence.
There was no one upon whom suspicion could fall
save Duncan Crane, who had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This fact was the saving of Valentine’s life. In view
of the possibility that Crane might be implicated, the judge
was lenient, and commuted the sentence of death to life imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course this was little better than death, but it gave
Albert his chance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He at once started upon the track of Crane. To Hawaii,
to Yokohama, he tracked the wretch.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Here the real murderer was stricken with the plague.
Upon his death-bed he made full and absolute confession.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was duly written out and witnessed by the American
Consul. Armed with this proof of his brother’s innocence,
Albert started for home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“He was happy in the thought that his brother would be
vindicated upon his arrival in San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But alas for his hopes. Fate had decreed that the confession
should never get there. It was upon his person when
devoured by the silver whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Valentine yet lingers in prison; his family are starving.
Now you have the whole sad story. I know you are a Christian
and a philanthropist, Frank. You will agree with me
that we ought to do something to right this great wrong
if we can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had listened to the thrilling story with the deepest
interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now he said in a puzzled way:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well and good, George; but how can we do it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Capture the silver whale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Capture the whale! What earthly good will that do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can, perhaps, recover the confession.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank whistled in surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, how absurd!” he exclaimed. “It must have become
absorbed long ago in the whale’s stomach. In any
event the creature has no doubt long ago been captured and
destroyed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” said Stanhope, firmly; “I do not believe that. I
have heard of the silver whale many times since. Numerous
whaling captains have reported it in parts contiguous
to the locality where poor Tucker met his fate. I believe
with this submarine boat we can pursue and capture the silver
whale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well; but the confession——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was folded and kept in a metal box or case which
Tucker wore in his belt. It could not be absorbed, and I
have seen objects of metal many times taken from the stomach
of a whale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank’s face lit up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“So it was in a metal case.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then there is a chance!” cried the young inventor,
springing up. “George, I am deeply interested. If the
silver whale is yet in existence, we will run it down and
recover the confession, if possible. It at least affords us
an object for our submarine voyage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Correct!” cried Stanhope. “I knew you would grasp
the idea, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will at once start for the North Pacific. Have your
effects ready.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“They are all ready!” declared Stanhope. “I have explored
every country upon the face of the earth. Now it is
my happy privilege to explore the bed of the sea. Am I
not a lucky man?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, Misther Frank,” cried a rollicking voice from
the yard. “We have ivery bit of provisions aboord, an’
shure it’s all ready to start we are!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” cried Frank. “There shall be no delay on my
part. We will be off at the quickest possible moment.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope at once went out and telegraphed Mrs. Tucker
in San Francisco.</p>

<hr class='c013' />
<p class='c000'><span class='sc'>Dear Madam</span>,—We start very soon in the submarine
boat Dolphin for the North Pacific in quest of the white
whale. Let us hope we shall find the evidence to clear your
husband. Be of cheerful mind.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r'>

</div>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c000'>The remainder of the day was spent in completing the
preparations for the start.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning all was announced in readiness.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin floated in the tank all ready for the start.</p>

<p class='c000'>The voyagers went aboard, and Frank gave orders for the
big gates to be opened. This was done, and the boat floated
into the canal.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here it was in plain view of the great crowd which was
waiting outside to greet it with cheers. The Dolphin floated
down the canal toward the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon it was in the current of the larger stream, and then
Frank started the electric engines to greater speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>This sent the Dolphin ahead at a lively rate and Readestown
began to fade from view.</p>

<p class='c000'>All of the voyagers were upon the main deck by the
open door of the pilot-house. Frank was at the wheel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take a good look at Readestown,” said the young inventor.
“It may be your last one!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Instinctively Barney and Pomp turned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s the foinest spot on earth!” cried the Celt.
“May we live to return to dear old Radestown!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly! I done fink dat we mus’ do dat,” averred Pomp.
“Dis chile neber gwine to leabe his bones in no oder place!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t yez be too shure, naygur,” declared Barney, shaking
his head. “Shure, it’s many a close call we’ll be afther
havin’ yit, me lad. There’s no spendin’ a year or more at
the bottom av the say widout some bit av a risk.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right, Barney,” said the explorer, Stanhope;
“but we are going to look upon the bright side of this thing.
We shall sail the North Pacific, capture the silver whale,
return and see old America again in safety. Mark my
prophecy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope you have hit it right, George,” laughed Frank;
“at least you are right in looking on the bright side.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So the submarine voyagers left home in quite a cheerful
frame of mind.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they little dreamed of the thrilling experiences which
the near future held.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had no means of guessing the terrible perils through
which they were to pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>A voyage under the sea can scarcely be attended by aught
but danger and risk.</p>

<p class='c000'>Readestown was soon left out of sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin sped on down the river current to the sea.
Thus far Frank had kept the boat on the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the open sea was reached he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think that for the first thousand miles of our course
we will travel faster under water. I have studied the ocean
bed, and there are no obstructions to encounter at the proper
mean elevation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then we are to start out at once with a thousand mile
voyage under water?” asked the explorer Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! I am very glad of that. There is much in the
Atlantic worthy of study. You will make the Pacific by
way of Cape Horn?”</p>

<p class='c000'>To Stanhope’s surprise Frank shook his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” he said. “That is the longest route.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What other is there?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the Northwest Passage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope was surprised.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, man,” he exclaimed, “that has never been discovered.
It does not exist!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes, it does,” averred Frank, “but it is never navigable
to surface vessels, owing to its being choked with ice. But
the Dolphin can go under the ice.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Under the ice?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wonderful!” cried Stanhope, excitedly. “I never
thought of that. It is certainly the nearest way to the
North Pacific. We shall pass into Behring Sea?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was already out of sight of land, and headed
northward. She was a fast sailer, and rode the waves like
a duck.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank now decided to begin his submarine voyage. He
went into the pilot-house and pressed a lever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly every door and window was hermetically sealed
and the electric lights were turned on full force.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin took a plunge beneath the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down it went until the glare of the electric lights revealed
a rare and wonderful scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>There were marine plants of queer and beautiful sort,
cliffs, crags and reefs of vari-colored coral, thousands of
fish of all hues and shapes, and many other strange and
marvelous things.</p>

<p class='c000'>The voyagers were for a time enchained by this wonderful
exhibition.</p>

<p class='c000'>Particularly was Stanhope enchanted, and he was anxious
to possess some of the wonderful specimens that he
saw.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How can I get some of that lovely coral, Frank?” he
cried. “It is a species I never saw before.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is only one way,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And how is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Simply put on a diving suit and go out there and get
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can I do that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Before Frank could answer a startling and terrible thing
happened. A cry of terror came from Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt had been in the pilot-house and chanced accidentally
to press the motive valve. Instantly the Dolphin
darted forward like an arrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney gripped the valve and tried to shut off the current
and check the awful speed of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he was unable to do this. For some reason or other
the valve stuck and would not move.</p>

<p class='c000'>No harm would have been done had the boat been a fathom
higher in the water, as there was no obstacle which
she could not easily have passed.</p>

<p class='c000'>But a moment later there was a terrific rending shock.
Every one was thrown from his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin came to a dead stop, and for an instant all
was darkness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IV' class='c009'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <span class='large'>THE SUNKEN WRECK—THE SHARK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The crash had for an instant broken the current, but
the light quickly flashed up again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The electric engines were whirring like a top, and seemed
likely to go to smash. But Frank Reade, Jr., was almost
instantly upon his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rushed into the engine-room and checked them. The
screw ceased its mad and useless revolutions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin had struck something.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was certain. But fortunately no breakage or puncture
of the hull had occurred, so there was no danger of
death by drowning like rats in a trap.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was motionless in her position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney pulled himself out of a corner. Pomp crawled
out of a heap of furniture, and Stanhope emerged from a
closet into which he had crashed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nobody was hurt, but there were bruises and scratches
galore.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, no one but was anxious to know the cause of the
catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accordingly all rushed into the pilot-house where Frank
was focusing the searchlight. This revealed the true state of
affairs at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>The obstruction into which the Dolphin had crashed was
nothing more nor less than the sunken frame of a decayed
vessel, half buried in the sands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The nose of the Dolphin had become so firmly wedged in
the timbers that it was held fast.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s stuck fast we are!” cried Barney, rubbing a
bruised shin. “Shure, Misther Frank, we’ll niver pull out
av that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is so, Frank!” cried Stanhope; “how can we ever
extricate ourselves?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can try,” said Frank, laconically.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor carefully examined the position of
the submarine boat. To his great joy he saw that she was
unhurt.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though she was tightly wedged in the debris of the wreck,
there was no visible damage done her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank hardly believed it possible to withdraw her from
the wreck with the aid of the screw alone.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet he was constrained to make the attempt.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he went into the engine-room and started the motor
upon the reverse. The screw revolved furiously; the engines
were exerted to their utmost.</p>

<p class='c000'>But all in vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The electric boat could not be drawn from her position by
hook or by crook. The situation was dubious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope looked grave.</p>

<p class='c000'>“How is it, Frank?” he asked. “Are we done for?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think not,” he said. “We shall find a way out of the
scrape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But how?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot explain now.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All but Frank looked serious. The young inventor did
not seem in the least perturbed.</p>

<p class='c000'>He went forward again and more closely studied the position
of the Dolphin. Then he returned.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Barney,” he said, “bring me that case from the forward
cabin in which are the diving suits.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All roight, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Away, went the Celt upon his errand. He presently returned
with a heavy box upon his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was deposited upon the cabin floor and opened.</p>

<p class='c000'>From it Frank took a diving suit, helmet and all.</p>

<p class='c000'>He proceeded at once to don it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are going to leave the boat, Frank?” asked Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“May I ask the privilege of accompanying you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If you wish,” replied Frank; “but my purpose is to saw
away the timbers which hold the Dolphin’s nose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I can help you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At once Stanhope proceeded to don another suit. Soon
both were attired, ready to leave the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank armed himself with a pike and saw, as did Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then they entered the vestibule. It quickly filled with
water, and a moment later they were able to emerge and
walk upon the bed of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank walked around the Dolphin and inspected its position.
Stanhope remained upon the opposite side.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank mounted the timbers over the Dolphin’s bow,
and began work with his saw. He worked away with all his
might to sever the heaviest timber which held the head of
the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was no light task, for the timber was of stoutest oak,
but Frank kept steadily at work.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he was able to accustom himself to the pressure
of the water, Stanhope joined him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both labored for fully an hour, and then the last timber
was sawed, and there was no doubt but that the boat could
easily float away from the wreck.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was saved, and the party could once more
go forward upon its submarine journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope endeavored to speak to Frank. But of course
the young inventor could not hear him.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, Frank guessed from his actions that he was endeavoring
to do this, so he advanced and placing his helmet
close to Stanhope’s, shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you wish to speak to me?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The words sounded to Stanhope far, far distant, but he
understood them, and replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is this the only way we can make ourselves understood?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You think that the Dolphin is now able to be removed?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad of that. Shall we return to the cabin now?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Unless you wish to conduct some research. If so, this is
your chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Stanhope replied:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think I will defer it until another time.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very well.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank turned to clamber down from the wreck, but even
as he did so he caught sight of a deadly peril.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was in the form of a huge body which he saw suddenly
loom up in the water not far distant.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was, as he saw at once, a species of shark, and a monster
in size. The creature had seen them and was moving
toward them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw that there was not time to reach the cabin before
the monster would be upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>For that he meant to attack them was a moral certainty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor gripped his companion’s arm in
warning. Stanhope saw the terrible peril.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instinctively he drew the pike from his belt and stood on
his guard. The shark, with a lightning-like movement,
described a parabola about them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank knew that they might expect a downward attack
from the monster.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it would have to turn upon its back to seize them,
the opportunity to strike a defensive blow would be good.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now came the attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shark came down from above like a thunderbolt.
Those on board the Dolphin saw this and were powerless to
act.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Be me sowl! It’s a divil av a shark afther thim!” cried
Barney. “An’ shure there’s no way to help thim at all, at
all!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, but dey jes’ be all killed!” screamed Pomp. “Don’
yo’ fink dar be nuffin’ we kin do?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Divil a bit!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Stanhope were ready to take care of themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the shark descended upon them both crouched low.</p>

<p class='c000'>The creature’s open jaws were not four feet from Frank
when he buried the pike in the shark’s body.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shock knocked him over, and he rolled upon the deck
of the sunken ship. Stanhope made a blow at the fish, but
missed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The monster flashed by like a meteor, and once again shot
up to make a fresh attack.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the blow given it had told.</p>

<p class='c000'>The water was full of blood, and the shark writhed as if
in pain.</p>

<p class='c000'>But once more it came down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Over upon its back it rolled. The horrid jaws were wide
open.</p>

<p class='c000'>This time it had not the strength to come as swiftly as
before. Its movements were sluggish.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this gave Stanhope his chance to deal the monster a
blow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Also Frank thrust his pike into the shark’s body. It was
the finishing stroke.</p>

<p class='c000'>The monster made a convulsive leap upward, beat the
water furiously, and then sank quivering but dying to the
ocean bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The struggle was over. Man had triumphed over brute.
The divers were the victors in this terrible battle.</p>

<p class='c000'>No time was wasted in returning to the cabin of the
Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank and Stanhope were both much exhausted with the
struggle, and both were glad to get their diving suits off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp welcomed them effusively.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, Misther Frank!” cried the Celt, “shure I was
shakin’ in me skin fer yez! But I niver yit seen yez outdone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank laughed at this.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a close call, Barney,” he declared; “but we were
lucky enough to pull out of the scrape.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin’s engines now were reversed, and she easily
pulled out of her predicament.</p>

<p class='c000'>So far as could be seen, she was not seriously injured.</p>

<p class='c000'>The spirits of the voyagers revived greatly, and the boat
now went on its way rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>But some one was constantly at the wheel. No chances
were taken now.</p>

<p class='c000'>The searchlight threw its radiance for a full mile ahead.
This enabled all obstructions to be seen and avoided.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin proved wonderfully stanch and seaworthy.
But at times her sides would creak and groan, which was
an indication that she was at too great a depth. Then it
would become necessary to raise her to a point where the
pressure would not be so tremendous.</p>

<p class='c000'>To attempt to describe in detail the wonders witnessed by
the crew of the Dolphin each day would require many volumes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Northward she kept for weeks, and then all became conscious
of the fact that they were getting into Arctic waters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank repeatedly studied his chart, and took note of the
formation of the ocean’s bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day he declared:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We are in the upper waters of Baffins Bay and under the
ice. Above us it must be twenty feet in thickness. If any
accident should happen to the Dolphin now we could never
hope to reach the surface. We should be buried forever in
these lonely depths.”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was an appalling thought, and the voyagers exchanged
glances.</p>

<p class='c000'>The words had barely left Frank’s lips when, as if to
emphasize his declaration, there came a stunning crash and
the Dolphin seemed likely to turn completely over.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='V' class='c009'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <span class='large'>BATTLE WITH A WHALE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Not one in the party but was hurled to the deck. But
each gained his feet quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My goodness! We are lost!” cried Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>But one thought was in Frank’s mind. He believed that
the Dolphin had run against a reef.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp had been in the pilot-house. It was a remissness
in duty upon his part if such was the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now from the pilot-house came the terrified cry:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, Marse Frank, for de lov’ ob goodness, cum yere
quick!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was not slow to respond.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rushed into the pilot-house to find Pomp hanging to
the wheel. The boat seemed to be flying.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is the matter? What did you strike?” shouted
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Didn’t strike nuffin’, sah. Somefin’ struck us, an’ it was
de berry bigges’ fish eber dis chile see!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A fish!” exclaimed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yas, sah! Jes’ look ober yonder.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank had reversed the motive key, and the Dolphin had
come to a stop. Dead ahead, in the glare of the searchlight,
was a monster body.</p>

<p class='c000'>What Pomp had called a fish Frank instantly recognized.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a monster whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cetacean, with the curiosity and pugnacity of its
species, had boldly attacked this giant invader of its deep sea
home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Full tilt it had rushed upon the Dolphin. Only the buoyancy
and strength of the submarine boat had saved it from
being crushed like an eggshell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even now it seemed to be preparing for another dash at
the Dolphin. Frank saw this.</p>

<p class='c000'>He instantly started the engine and whirled the boat
about so as to meet the whale head on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin had a ram, and if the whale should come
in contact with this it would be a serious affair for him.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the sea monster seemed inclined to accept the challenge.</p>

<p class='c000'>One moment it hung there in the current; then it lowered
its head apparently, and made a convulsive movement with
its mighty flukes.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is coming!” cried Stanhope, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was true enough.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instinctively all braced for the shock which they knew
must come.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank opened the lever wide. The Dolphin darted forward
like lightning.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the whale, wary as its kind always are, and uncertain,
suddenly took a lightning-like downward plunge.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ram of the Dolphin barely scraped its back. The
shock threw all off their feet, but no further harm was done.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly Frank sprang to the wheel and whirled the
Dolphin about.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew what to expect, and this was that the whale
would return to the attack from a new quarter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed he could already see the monster turning to carry
out this plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin came about just in time; the whale once
more faced its leviathan opponent.</p>

<p class='c000'>This time the cetacean did not seem inclined to avoid the
collision. It bore down full tilt for the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank instantly started the engines.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then came the collision.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a most terrific one.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ram struck the whale square in the forehead. It
glanced and plowed its way through the monster.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whale was instantly killed, but the submarine boat
was now in a fix. The ram was immovably fixed in the flesh
of the huge monster.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was really a serious matter. In vain Frank tried to
back the boat away.</p>

<p class='c000'>The engines were not powerful enough to extricate the
ram.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was firmly fixed.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now the buoyant body of the whale began to rise.
Being greater in lightness than the Dolphin, it took it along
with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up toward the surface went the boat and fish.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank knew that the surface of the ocean was frozen solid.
They would not come to open air, but in contact with the ice
above.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this was just what happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a sudden jar, and the boat and whale rested
against the surface of ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under ordinary circumstances this might have done no
damage.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the current now began to drag the boat and whale
along the surface of the ice forcibly.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was powerful at this spot, and Frank saw that something
must be done, or much damage would be done the
Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor was for a moment at a loss just what
to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then an idea occurred to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were scraping along the ice violently. Frank went
below and brought up a curious-looking object.</p>

<p class='c000'>It looked like a small pontoon boat, but something after
the pattern of the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Stanhope recognized its nature at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a light torpedo, and could be discharged from a
shaft just aft the ram in the bow of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A torpedo!” exclaimed the great explorer. “Are you
going to use it, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is there no risk? May it not do us more harm than anything
else?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think not,” replied the young inventor. “This is a
very light one, and the charge I think is not strong enough.
If it will dislodge the whale that is the best we may ask.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Most certainly; but do you think it is sufficient?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We can only try.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is right.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank went forward and placed the torpedo in the tube.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was operated by pneumatic pressure, but the force
of expulsion was great enough to send it a long way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank now fired the tube. The torpedo shot forth and
struck the whale in its side. The result was instantaneous.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a shock. The Dolphin reeled and the water
boiled about her. Then as it cleared it was seen that the
monster had been literally blown in two pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ram was almost liberated, and as the air bladder of
the fish was broken it now began to sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank now rushed back to the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quickly he donned his diving suit. Stanhope, seeing the
risk, tried to remonstrate with him.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank did not listen; he left the cabin and was quickly
out upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>He crept along until well out on the ram. In his right
hand he carried a keen hatchet.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the work of but a few moments to cut away the
section of blubber, and the boat was free.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once it began to sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank crept back into the cabin safely, and into the
overjoyed arms of his companions, who were indeed glad
of his success.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That was a plucky thing to do, Frank,” cried Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the young inventor only smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There are more difficult things,” he declared; “there
was no other way.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Dolphin had now reached the bottom again.
She was unscathed by her thrilling experience.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank now started her ahead upon her northward trip.</p>

<p class='c000'>The further north they proceeded, the more shallow, grew
the ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many curious things were seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, as the boat was driving along at a lively rate,
Barney, who was in the wheel-house, saw an object dead
ahead.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it was in the course of the boat he checked speed.
Drawing nearer slowly he focussed the electric light and received
a startling surprise.</p>

<p class='c000'>At once he cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurroo! Misther Frank, wud yez cum here, sor?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank at once responded.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What is it, Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, it’s a ship!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A ship?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yis, sor. Sunken under the wather, sor. A rale ship,
sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>At once Frank was interested. He gazed out through a
dead-eye window, and saw that Barney was right.</p>

<p class='c000'>There, in the path of the Dolphin was a sunken ship. It
was full rigged, and had apparently gone down with all
sails set.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was more, it was a whaling vessel, as its blackened
funnels and high bulwarks attested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A sunken whale ship!” cried Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope heard him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it?” he cried. “Mercy! What a sad fate!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But the Arctic holds many such.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right. Shall we stop to search her, Frank?”
asked the explorer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor shook his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think not,” he replied. “It will be hardly worth
while. Besides, we must make this Northwest Passage before
the Arctic winter sets in.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin now entered a labyrinth of channels and
straits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Only a master mind like Frank Reade, Jr.’s could have
emerged successfully from this tangle.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he succeeded, and one day, after a long threading of
such passages, he appeared in the cabin with a startling
declaration.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have made the Northwest Passage and shall soon
emerge into the Behring Sea. We will before many days
be in hot pursuit of the silver whale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope sprang up and swung his cap excitedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” he shouted. “That is a great achievement in
more than one sense. We have proved the existence of the
Northwest Passage, which has been a subject of such doubt
among mariners for hundreds of years.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You mean that we have proved the existence of the
passage, but not that it is navigable,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, but it is that!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I fear not!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And why not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“There is every indication that it is perpetually blocked
with ice. No vessel could find its way through.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yet we did.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are caught!” he said. “We will allow that it is
navigable for a submarine boat. But only think! Very
shortly we shall be in quest of the silver whale!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us hope that we shall succeed in finding him,”
cried Stanhope, hopefully. “And also the confession which
will save Valentine Tucker.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Amen to that.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin plowed the waters of the Behring Sea. The
frightful cold of the Arctic waters now began to lessen.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was evident that they were nearing the warmer waters
of the Pacific. And in due time the Aleutian Isles were
passed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VI' class='c009'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ENGLISH SHIP.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Dolphin had made a wonderful trip.</p>

<p class='c000'>Under water for so many hundreds of miles, under Arctic
ice, and through the least known parts of the ocean she
had safely come.</p>

<p class='c000'>Truly the voyagers had good reason to congratulate themselves
upon the success of their undertaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the really thrilling experiences of the voyage were
before them, though they little realized it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Into the North Pacific they made their way, and even into
those latitudes which it was believed were frequented by
the wonderful silver whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>Plenty of whales had been seen, but all were of the common
variety.</p>

<p class='c000'>The random quest had now begun, for it could be little
else. There was no way of guessing the locality of the
silver whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>The creature might swim those seas for years and not
be encountered by those in quest of it. But Frank hoped for
better luck.</p>

<p class='c000'>At any moment there was the chance of coming across it.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the first opportunity Frank hoped to capture it. And
thus the Dolphin cruised aimlessly about.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course she cruised on the surface most of the time, for
here was where it was believed the whale would be quickest
seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every distant spouting whale was run down, only to find
that it was a common whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length even Stanhope began to lose courage.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We ought to get a glimpse of his whaleship soon,” said
Frank one day, after weeks of useless quest. “Is it not
very strange?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, I think so,” said Stanhope. “Yet I believe the
time is near.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have good courage.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Which is my good fortune.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, that is so. An ordinary man would have given
up the quest long ago.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I dare say.”</p>

<p class='c000'>But one day Barney remarked:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sail ho!”</p>

<p class='c000'>This cry caused a little ripple of excitement. Frank
answered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“A sail is it, Barney?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, sor, it is!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whereaway?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Dead to windward, sor.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All went upon the platform deck of the Dolphin with
glasses and viewed the distant vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>She carried a cloud of canvas, and was evidently a fast
sailer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Upon my word!” cried Stanhope, “she looks like one of
the old-time Indiamen or tea wagons!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right,” agreed Frank. “But it can hardly be
so. What would she be doing in these waters?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She may have been blown from her course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, mebbe she’s wan av thim fast English cutters
what comes around here poaching for Ameriky’s seals!”
cried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope gave a start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I guess you’ve hit it, Barney,” he cried. “There is little
doubt of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall we hail her?” asked Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope hesitated a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I thought we should gain any information of value,”
he said, “I would certainly be in favor if it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It shall be so. We can no more than try.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank went to the wheel-house and headed the Dolphin
for the distant ship. Barney went to the upper deck with a
flag.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cutter was a fast sailer, but the Dolphin easily overhauled
her. The actions of the ship were very queer. She
was evidently trying to run away from the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some moments Frank was puzzled.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is queer,” he exclaimed. “She seems to be afraid of
us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps she thinks we are some sort of an American
war cruiser,” ventured Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw the truth at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Correct!” he cried. “Then our only way it to get within
hailing distance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>For miles the chase went on. The cutter spread every
inch of canvas, but the Dolphin overhauled her.</p>

<p class='c000'>When not one hundred yards astern of the big ship Frank
mounted the forward and highest deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had a speaking trumpet, and shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ship ahoy! What ship is that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain evidently saw that to attempt to run away
from the fleet Dolphin was sheer folly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The rigging was crowded with sailors. These began to
reef and haul, and the ship came around to her helm.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the captain himself appeared in the shrouds.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy!” he shouted.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy!” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“This is the English cutter, Southampton. Who are</p>

<p class='c000'>“The American submarine boat, Dolphin,” replied
Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ship of war?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No; a private vessel. And we are in these waters upon
an important errand. We seek information from you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This announcement had an electrical effect upon the
cutter’s captain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The announcement that the Dolphin was not a war vessel
changed the complexion of things at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down came the big sails of the Southampton, and the
captain shouted:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Come alongside. I’m glad to meet friends in these
lonely waters. I’ll help you all I can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That’s the way to talk,” said Frank. “I’ll go aboard.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Will yez have the Dolphin’s boat, sor?” asked Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied Frank. “Get it out as quick as you can.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt needed no second bidding.</p>

<p class='c000'>He and Pomp were quickly at work. The boat was out
in a jiffy. Frank turned to Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you want to go with me?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied the other, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>They stepped into the light craft and rowed away over the
dancing waves.</p>

<p class='c000'>A moment later they were ascending the gangway of the
Southampton.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain met them at the head of the stairs. He was
a genial-featured son of Britain.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I greet you, gentlemen,” he said. “I am Theodore
Briggs, captain of this ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am Frank Reade, Jr., captain of the Dolphin,” replied
Frank. “This is my friend, Mr. Stanhope.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This formality over, the captain of the Southampton led
the way to his cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will share my hospitality,” he said. “A glass of old
Madeira.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The wine was good, and at once established good feelings.</p>

<p class='c000'>After a few cursory remarks, Captain Briggs ventured to
ask:</p>

<p class='c000'>“In your hail, Captain Reade, you vouchsafed the statement
that I could help you. I should be pleased to know in
what way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly,” replied Frank. “But first, let me tell you
a strange story.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he recited the object of their mission in these seas,
and dwelt particularly upon the sad fate of poor Albert
Tucker.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Briggs listened with the deepest interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>When Frank had finished, he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Your tale interests me much, Captain Reade. Perhaps
I may be of assistance to you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!” exclaimed Frank, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have seen this white or silver whale. It is no myth,
but a reality. Not twenty-four since it blowed not fifty
yards from our quarters. We tried then to harpoon it, and
chased it for some ways. But it was too wary.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That information is of the utmost value to me!” cried
Frank, joyfully. “For I know that the strange whale is
yet in existence. It is hardly likely that there are two of
the species in this vicinity.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad, then, if I have been of service,” said the
captain, warmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed you have.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Can I aid you in any other way?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thank you, but I think not. I will at once start the
chase for the monster. I hope to make his acquaintance
soon.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope you will, and that I may know the result of your
attempt.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You shall.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank went on deck and was escorted to the gangway.
The captain of the Southampton was a master of politeness.</p>

<p class='c000'>He greeted Frank warmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at this moment a great cry went up.</p>

<p class='c000'>“There she blows—the silver whale!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly all eyes swept the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whereaway?” shouted Captain Briggs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Two points to leeward!”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no disputing the fact. There in plain view
upon the surface of the sea, its white sides glistening in the
sunlight, was the silver whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>The excitement on board both vessels was most intense.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sailors of the Southampton excitedly filled the
shrouds. For a moment Captain Briggs and Frank gazed
at the monster without being able to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank made a start for the gangway. He was
about to leap down into the boat with Stanhope, when Captain
Briggs placed a hand upon his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will help you!” he cried. “I will lower boats, and
we will capture the monster.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I thank you,” replied Frank, hastily; “pardon my sudden
departure.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he dropped into the boat beside Stanhope. Barney
and Pomp, on board the Dolphin, with wonderful sagacity,
had started the engines so as to lessen the rowing distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Quick, George!” cried Frank. “We must get back to
the Dolphin as soon as possible. There is no time to lose.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right,” cried Stanhope, as he bent to the oars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The light boat literally flew through the water. In less
time than it takes to tell it, they sprang aboard the submarine
boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney drew the boat aboard and secured it. Pomp had
already started the Dolphin in pursuit of the whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was quickly in the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>He grasped the wheel, and then the boat shot forward like
a flash. The Dolphin was a very speedy craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whale would have been quickly impaled on her ram,
but at that moment it seemed to take a sudden freak and
dived.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down it instantly went out of sight. Frank was for a
moment chagrined.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he instantly took active measures to pursue. He
pressed the reservoir valve and the Dolphin sank.</p>

<p class='c000'>Down for a hundred feet she went.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank did not believe that the whale would dive deeper
than this.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the descent of the Dolphin Frank instantly pressed
the electric valve.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly the sea for a great radius about was illumined.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw the distant form of the whale racing before
the light like mad.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor instantly set the pace.</p>

<p class='c000'>On through the water went the mad flight of pursuer and
pursued.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was indeed hard to say which held the advantage.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whale seemed to hold its own by gyratory motions
which it was difficult for the Dolphin to follow with accuracy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <span class='large'>CHASING THE SILVER WHALE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>But still Frank believed that the Dolphin was gaining.</p>

<p class='c000'>He entertained one fond hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was that the whale would turn and show fight. He
knew the inherent pugnacity of the species.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it did not.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some reason or other it chose to hold its erratic
course. To attempt to overtake it was impossible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw this, but yet hoped that some turn of fortune
would aid him. The chase came to a termination, though,
in a peculiar way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the whale vanished as quickly as though dispelled
into mist. Frank fancied that it had taken a turn
at right angles.</p>

<p class='c000'>He instantly slackened the engines. The Dolphin was
coming about when she found herself immersed in a cloud,
which even the electric light could not penetrate.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing could be seen in any direction. All was blackness.
It was an astounding turn of affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great heavens!” cried Stanhope. “What has happened?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was at a standstill, preparatory to coming
about.</p>

<p class='c000'>For an instant Frank did not know what to do.</p>

<p class='c000'>Which way had the whale gone? What did the sudden
wave of darkness mean?</p>

<p class='c000'>The answer came almost instantly, and in a startling way.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly at the pilot-house window there loomed up a
giant face, as full of deviltry and cunning as ever was seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had a hawk-like beak, cruel jaws, and eyes round and
cat-like. Great arms, adorned with curious feelers of
spongy material, completely enveloped the hull of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that instant all recognized the nature of the creature.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An octopus!” screamed Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was truly one of that monster variety of cuttlefish or
octopus which inhabit the depths of the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c000'>The black mist in the water was now easily explained.</p>

<p class='c000'>The octopus possesses a bag filled with an inky fluid
which it dispenses through the water upon the approach of
danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was filled with horror and dismay. Not that he
feared the attack of the octopus, but it was the means of his
losing track of the white whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>The arms of the octopus held the boat securely. Its ravenous
beak beat furiously against the cabin window.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course its strength was not sufficient to break it, nor
could any harm be done the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was a question of no light sort as to how they
were to release themselves from the clutches of the monster.
Of course this must be done before they could hope to
proceed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What a shame!” cried Stanhope. “We have now lost
track of the silver whale.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is hard luck,” agreed Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We must make the best of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course. First to get rid of this encumbrance and
then to go on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., was not the one to be puzzled by a
contingency of this kind—at least, he could not be baffled.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had soon hit upon an expedient.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the engine-room he had procured a long coil of
wire; then he donned some rubber gloves and connected the
wire with the dynamos.</p>

<p class='c000'>Enough of the current could be thus furnished to kill a
dozen men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank handled the wire carefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>The feelers of the octopus were pressed against the steel
frame of the pilot-house. Frank made a clever circuit,
throwing the current suddenly into the steel frame.</p>

<p class='c000'>The effect was electrical and fatal to the octopus.</p>

<p class='c000'>It received the whole charge of a number of thousand
volts. At once its huge arms relaxed, and it sank back.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was freed from its encumbrance, and now
could go ahead with ease.</p>

<p class='c000'>The inky cloud which had obscured the water had now
become dispelled. The searchlight’s rays flashed everywhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the silver whale was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had made good its escape. Once more it was like looking
for a needle in a haystack.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certainly the outlook was discouraging. But Frank
Reade, Jr., had the right kind of pluck.</p>

<p class='c000'>He would never give up while there was a certainty that
the silver whale was in existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will find him again!” he declared. “Possibly he is
even now not far off.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Perhaps on the surface,” ventured Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank touched the lever, and the boat instantly rose to
the surface. As it came up into daylight every eye scanned
the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Everywhere was the unbroken expanse of rolling brine.
Only one object was visible, and that was a white sail far
distant on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c000'>That it was the ship Southampton was probable.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall we rejoin her?” asked Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think not,” replied Frank. “Nothing will be gained.
Let her go her way. We may work better alone.”</p>

<p class='c000'>So this was the last seen of the English cutter. Her
sails were soon invisible.</p>

<p class='c000'>For some while the Dolphin traveled on the surface of the
sea. Then Frank decided to go down.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the Dolphin descended once more to submarine depths.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a whole day she kept on thus. Then, as night was
coming on, the object of the quest was again seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The silver whale was floating lazily in a growth of submarine
plants not a quarter of a mile distant. It did not
seem conscious of the approach of the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was in the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor instantly brought the Dolphin to a
stop. He had decided this time upon more cautious tactics.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was determined to make sure of his game this time.</p>

<p class='c000'>He allowed the Dolphin to float gradually nearer to the
monster.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope was with him in the pilot-house.</p>

<p class='c000'>The explorer watched Frank’s tactics with great eagerness.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You have given up the idea of trying to run down and
ram the whale?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied Frank. “I am going to try a different
game.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Torpedoes?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank took a torpedo and went forward. He placed it in
the tube. Drawing a careful line on the whale, he pressed
the pneumatic lever.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a recoil and a muffled report. The torpedo
had sailed through the water apparently in a straight course
for the whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>Had it struck the cetacean it would have proved its end.
But unfortunately this was not the case.</p>

<p class='c000'>The torpedo just passed over the body of the whale.
Gliding fifty yards beyond it struck a reef, and exploded
with terrible force.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a few moments the water literally boiled in the vicinity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whale shot forward like a stone from a catapult.</p>

<p class='c000'>One moment it was visible flying in the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quick as thought Frank saw his mistake and acted.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sprang into the pilot-house and pressed the motor
key. The boat shot forward like a flash.</p>

<p class='c000'>Straight after the whale it went. One moment the latter
was visible. Then a great wall of blackness loomed up and
the whale vanished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not recognizing the nature of this trick, and fearing a
dangerous obstacle, Frank pressed the lever forward and
brought the boat to a stop.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great Scott!” cried Stanhope, excitedly, “it is a big
submarine cave, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A cave!” gasped the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly. A cave under the sea. The whale has gone
into it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was certainly the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was greatly surprised. He gazed into the mouth
of the cavern in amazement.</p>

<p class='c000'>It extended far into the bowels, of the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank brought the searchlight to bear upon the inner regions
of the cave.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wonderful sight was revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to be carved out of a stone which was emerald-like
in color and broken into various conformations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sight was dazzling, and the explorers gazed upon it
spellbound.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra! but it’s a beautiful sight!” cried Barney, with
mouth agape. “Did any av yez iver see the loikes av it?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed, it is grand beyond anything I have ever seen!”
exclaimed Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank was the first to recover from the spell of wonder
upon the party.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was looking for the whale.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had vanished into one of the labyrinthian passages and
left no trace behind it.</p>

<p class='c000'>How far this extended none in the party could guess.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Dolphin was able to penetrate some distance into
the cavern, for the arches were high.</p>

<p class='c000'>For what seemed like an interminable distance the Dolphin
threaded its way into the depths.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was hopeful, even sanguine, that the silver whale
was at last entrapped.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course there was the possibility that it had escaped by
some other outlet. In this case it was no doubt by this time
far away.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank pressed forward as far as the size of the Dolphin
would admit.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then the sides of the submarine boat collided with the
walls of stone. It could go no further.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here was a predicament. The voyagers exchanged puzzled
glances. What was to be done?</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was thoughtful. Stanhope paced up and down
nervously. Barney sputtered and Pomp fumed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra! I niver see the bate av it!” cried the Celt;
“that whale is loike the divil’s own. He do be squeezing
out av the smallest holes I iver see!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, but I done fink he am got away now fo’ suah!”
rejoined Pomp. “It am a drefful shame we didn’t shoot
it wif dat torpedo!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, it’s a hoodoo yez are, naygur!” declared Barney,
unable to restrain giving Pomp a jab.</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky shook his woolly head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yo am drefful smart, Mistah I’ish,” he retorted. “If
yo’ don’ look out yo’ might die young.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, I’ll surely die afore this voyage is out if yez
bring us any more such luck, yez omadhaun!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney’s bantering manner was like a red flag in the eyes
of a mad bull to Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’ yo’ call me any sich names ag’in, sah, or by mah
soul I done gib yo’ de worst trashin’ yo’ eber had.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Whurroo! Mebbe yez had betther thry it!” howled Barney,
dancing about like a dervish, and all ready for a ruction.</p>

<p class='c000'>It began to look as if one would occur.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='VIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE CONFESSION FOUND.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>But before the controversy could be brought to an issue or
a decision a thrilling thing occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>A terrific yell escaped Stanhope’s lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Look out!” he screamed, “for your lives, everybody!
Take care!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade instantly sprang forward. The explorer was
in the pilot-house window.</p>

<p class='c000'>He gripped a section of the partition, and with one finger
pointed ahead down the pathway of electric light.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was the whale coming like a meteor head on for
the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had evidently been to the extreme end of the passage,
and turning, was now making a mad charge for the enemy
in its path.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fury personified was the silver monster, as with wide open
jaws it came straight down for the craft.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Frank quickly pressed the lever and set the engines
in motion. It was just the contingency he wished.</p>

<p class='c000'>He realized that the game was already bagged.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the whale struck the ram of the Dolphin its fate would
be sealed. This was beyond dispute.</p>

<p class='c000'>On like a meteor came the monster.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a brief flash of silver in the glare of light, then
a stunning shock.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed as if the Dolphin would go to pieces.</p>

<p class='c000'>Portable objects went crashing about the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when the boat once more became still and all had
recovered from the terrific blow, a startling sight was revealed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whale had struck the ram head on, and the keen steel
projection had literally split the monster to its vitals.</p>

<p class='c000'>Glancing along the course of the jaw, the ram had cut the
whale half in two.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was as dead as a door post. The famous silver whale
was no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>Perhaps the most excited of the party was Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>The famous explorer could hardly contain himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hooray!” he shouted. “We have carried out our project!
The game is won!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“And the silver whale is ours!” rejoined Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are right, Frank. Now, the next thing is to investigate
its stomach and see if the metal case can be found.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It shall be done.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Preparations were at once made to carry out this plan.
The diving suits were donned, and all equipped themselves
with sharp knives and pikes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a critical time, for all depended upon the success
of this attempt to find the metal ease containing the confession.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of course, there was only a slight possibility that it had
remained intact in the whale’s stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was the likelihood that other substances had long
since corroded and consumed it.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that case Valentine Tucker must continue to languish
for the crime of which he was not guilty.</p>

<p class='c000'>All that could be done would then have been done. At
least the party could console themselves with this thought.</p>

<p class='c000'>Work was at once begun dissecting the stomach and intestines
of the whale. It was no slight task.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was necessary to proceed with the utmost caution and
care. Every little shred, every cell was carefully looked
into.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as the inspection progressed it became more and
more certain that the metal case was not among the contents
of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some foreign substances were found. A pewter cup, a
knife worn dull, and what looked like a marling-spike, but
so consumed that it could hardly be identified.</p>

<p class='c000'>Certainly the metal case was not among the contents of
the stomach. It looked as if the theory and the enterprise
had signally failed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The divers sat down for a moment to rest.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were deeply disappointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Conversation was out of the question, for one could not
make himself heard except when the helmets were placed
close together.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as they sat there the water current lifted a part of the
lining of the whale’s stomach and deposited it across Stanhope’s
knee.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was about to brush it away when something caused
him to halt. Instantly he lifted the shred of flesh and membrane
and passed his hand over it.</p>

<p class='c000'>There, grown into the lining, was an object a trifle larger
than a man’s hand.</p>

<p class='c000'>From outward appearance it looked like a tumor growth,
but Stanhope’s fingers detected the hard substance underneath.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew well enough that it was quite possible for objects
to grow into the lining even of the human stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wild, eager hope seized him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly he drew the blade of his knife across the membrane.
An object slipped out.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was rusty and corroded, but in the glare of the electric
light it was not hard for him to recognize its character at
once.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the metal case.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope held it up with insane gestures. Frank, Barney
and Pomp saw and understood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly all started for the cabin of the submarine boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>They were quickly aboard, and once the diving suits were
off Stanhope yelled with glee:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah! We have succeeded! Here is what will save
the life of Valentine Tucker! It is an act of Providence!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The corroded case lay upon the cabin table.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank looked at it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you believe this is the particular case?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is hardly likely that there is any other,” replied the
explorer.</p>

<p class='c000'>“True, but——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It has been a long time exposed to destructive agents.
Perhaps the papers inside are consumed.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope had thought of this. There was a light of
anxiety in his eyes, but he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will hope for the best. Let us know our fate.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The hermetical sealing of the case was yet intact, and
rendered doubly so by rust.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was quite impossible to open it without destroying
the case itself. But Stanhope did not hesitate to do this.</p>

<p class='c000'>He struck the metal a hard blow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instantly the case parted. To the delight of all, a crisp,
folded paper rolled out.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was covered with writing, and was as intact as the day
it was placed there.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the bottom of the confession was the name of Duncan
Crane, and also that of the witnesses. The evidence was
complete.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope was the most delighted man in the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>He carefully gathered up the remains of the metal case
and the papers and placed them securely away. Then he
declared unctuously:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am ready for anything. What joy I shall bring to
the sorrowing wife and stricken husband!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hardly think their pleasure will be greater than yours,”
said Frank, with a laugh.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Very true,” agreed Stanhope; “this is the happiest
achievement of my life, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The remains of the silver whale were left in the cavern.
The Dolphin backed out and into the open sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank touched the lever and she flew up to the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>All around was the unbroken expanse of sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the horizon line it extended almost in a dead calm.
But as the voyagers went out on deck to enjoy the bracing
air, Stanhope cried:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Sail ho!”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was easy to locate the sail just below the line.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was rising rapidly, and they were evidently in the vessel’s
course.</p>

<p class='c000'>What the character of the craft was it was not easy as yet
to tell.</p>

<p class='c000'>But most of the party reckoned that it was the Southampton,
until after it had become more plainly visible.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then it was settled beyond all doubt that it was not
the English cutter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Curiosity impelled all to wish to learn the character of the
strange vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>So the Dolphin headed toward her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every moment the two vessels drew nearer. Then Frank,
who had been studying the unknown vessel through a glass,
declared:</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is a brig of the first class and she has not yet sighted
us. We are, however, directly in her course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall we wait and speak her?” asked Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we will.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it not curious that she has not sighted us yet?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think not. You see, our boat rests so low in the water
that she would be easily overlooked.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Exactly. I have great curiosity to know what vessel this
is, and what her mission is in this out-of-the-way part of
the world.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We shall soon know.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearer every moment drew the unknown vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now it was seen that she had sighted the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was made manifest by a gun fired from her bow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin could not answer save by displaying a flag.
This was, however, recognized.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearer the two boats drew, and soon the brig was in
speaking distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was seen that she floated the American flag.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her appearance was, however, a mystery, for she did not
have the bearing of either a whaler or a trader.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the mystery was soon solved.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ahoy!” came from the brig.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ship ahoy!” replied Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What craft are you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The submarine boat Dolphin, of Readestown, U. S. A.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Submarine boat?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Jewhittaker! What kind of a craft may that be?” came
back the astonished query. “Not for sailing under the
sea?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes,” replied Frank, “just for that. What ship are
you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The ship Belden. Captain Uriah Snow, from New
Bedford, U. S. A.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am captain of this boat, the Dolphin, Frank Reade,
Jr. I give you my compliments.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“The same to you. Will you not come aboard?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Aye, aye!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank turned to Pomp and Barney and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Get out the pontoon boat. We will pay Captain Uriah
a visit.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='IX' class='c009'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <span class='large'>THE VALLEY OF PEARLS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Barney and Pomp were not slow in obeying this command.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pontoon was quickly out of the cabin and the air-chambers
filled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then all three took seats in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Stanhope was left aboard the Dolphin to look out for matters
until their return.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quickly the pontoon pulled over to the gangway of the
Belden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank mounted quickly to the deck, where he was
met by Captain Snow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were left in the boat to chat and gas
with the sailors of the big brig, and they kept their end up
well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah Snow was a tall, shrewd-looking man of
perhaps fifty years of age.</p>

<p class='c000'>He shook Frank’s hand warmly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am glad to meet you, Captain Reade,” he said; “pray
come into the cabin.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Thank you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In the cabin, as usual, wine and the customary civilities
were indulged in. Then Captain Snow said bluntly:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Of course you must have some mission in this part of
the world with your submarine boat, Mr. Reade?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have accomplished it,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Success has been mine.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You are fortunate. But what may your mission have
been?”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank as briefly as possible told of the quest for the silver
whale and the object therefor.</p>

<p class='c000'>Snow listened with interest.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wonderful!” he cried, as Frank finished; “it is wonderful!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he sprang to his feet and paced the deck excitedly.
Frank was, of course, not a little surprised.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Captain Uriah suddenly recollected himself and
paused.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Pardon me!” he exclaimed. “I was so deeply engrossed
that I quite forgot myself. There is a matter upon my
mind which I must broach to you. It is a great project,
and I know I shall have your co-operation.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Indeed!” was all Frank could say.</p>

<p class='c000'>“No doubt I surprise you; but I am very much in earnest.
It is a scheme which I have been some years in bringing
about. But its safe consummation will certainly bring
me a great fortune. This I will willingly share with you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank was interested.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should be pleased to know of your project,” he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good! I knew that I would get your interest. The
fact that you have a submarine boat makes me feel perfectly
sure of success.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“If I can help you in any way,” said Frank, “I shall be
very happy to do so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thousand thanks. But now let me tell you my story.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A dozen years ago I was upon the staff of a corps of
naval engineers, sent by the Government to obtain soundings
in these seas, and to make as accurate a survey as possible
of the ocean bed at this point.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank nodded in reply. The subject was getting more
absorbing.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We made soundings,” continued Captain Uriah, “and
came in the course of our survey across a deep valley. At
every rise of the sounding shaft there were brought up with
the mud indications of a deposit of pearls of priceless value,
as they were of the finest quality.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We became satisfied that beneath us, and for the distance
of a mile there existed a valley of pearls in which there
lay a mighty fortune.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank gave a start.</p>

<p class='c000'>“A valley of pearls!” he exclaimed. “That is indeed
wonderful. I am much interested, Captain Snow.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I knew that you would be. But to continue: As soon
as the survey was completed of course our cutter was obliged
to return home.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We knew that we were leaving a mighty fortune behind
us, but we could not help that.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We were under orders and in the service of the United
States Government. Our orders had been to make soundings
and a survey and then to report at once at San Francisco.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But, nevertheless, we took careful bearings, and felt sure
that we could return to the exact spot at some future day.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Best-laid plans often fail, however. Before we could
reach San Francisco, we were overtaken by a terrible storm.
The cutter was not exactly seaworthy, and had ought to have
been condemned before the cruise began. She sprang a leak,
and we were obliged to take to the boats.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Myself and Lieutenant Fish were the last to leave the
vessel.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We were left only the captain’s gig, but by the best of
good fortune, it weathered the storm, and we were picked up
four days later by a French brig.</p>

<p class='c000'>“The other members of the cutter’s crew were never heard
from. They doubtless perished.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fish died in ’Frisco of the effects of our four days on
the sea, and I was the only living person possessed of the
knowledge of the locality of the valley of pearls and its
bearings.</p>

<p class='c000'>“For several years I drifted about, striving to get enough
together to procure a ship and crew and come hither. I
have at last secured this stanch vessel, and here I am.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c000'>“In what manner do you expect to recover the pearls?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ah, that has been the problem,” replied Captain Snow.
“I have on board every sort of diving apparatus. But the
depth is so great that I fear the risk of descending.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“An ordinary diving suit would never do,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“But I have a plan for dredging. It is not of the most
perfect kind——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Wait,” said Frank, with resolution. “Set all your
doubts at rest. I have a plan by which you can recover your
pearls. If you will accept the offer I will place the Dolphin
at your disposal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>A glad, eager cry escaped Captain Uriah’s lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>“That is grand!” he cried. “I had not dared to broach
the matter to you. But I see that you are very kindly disposed
to assist me. There is fortune enough there for many
and all of us.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank made a deprecatory gesture.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I care not for the fortune,” he said; “but I am interested
in your project and will gladly help you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A thousand thanks!” cried Captain Uriah, wildly; “the
problem is then all settled. With your submarine boat it
will be easy enough to recover enough of the pearls to satisfy
us. I shall never forget this favor, Mr. Reade.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Don’t mention it,” said Frank, politely. “Are we far
from the locality of the pearl valley?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe we are not a dozen miles from the spot.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then let us locate it at once. If you will come aboard
the Dolphin it shall be placed at your disposal.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will do so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah hustled away to make provision. Soon
he was at the gangway all in readiness with mining tools
and two of his crew.</p>

<p class='c000'>They entered one of the ship’s boats and were rowed over
to the Dolphin, as the pontoon was too light to hold them
all.</p>

<p class='c000'>It had been arranged that the Belden should hover about
the vicinity for several days, or until the Dolphin should
return from her submarine quest.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then all went aboard the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank showed Captain Uriah over the boat, explaining to
him its mechanism.</p>

<p class='c000'>The old captain was more than interested. He was dazed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, well!” he exclaimed in a dreamy way, “I can
hardly realize it all! It seems as if I must be in some other
part of the world. I cannot understand it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Frank pressed the lever which hermetically sealed
doors and windows.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin plunged beneath the surface. Down she
went until the electric lights showed the gleaming sands
of the ocean bed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then began the quest for the valley of pearls.</p>

<p class='c000'>For fully a day the Dolphin cruised about. Then the
electric light showed a half mile distant huge pillars of
stone, showing the entrance to a submarine valley or sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin approached this rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Reaching the huge pillars it passed between them. The
valley of pearls was spread to view.</p>

<p class='c000'>There they lay in heaps upon the bed of the valley. They
glistened and shone in the electric light beautifully.</p>

<p class='c000'>Truly it was a wonderful sight. Words cannot describe
the keen joy of Captain Uriah.</p>

<p class='c000'>He danced and sang and screamed in his delight.</p>

<p class='c000'>“By the horn spoon!” he cried, “my fondest dreams are
realized! Pearls, pearls, beautiful pearls! Truly they are
gorgeous beyond all description.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Even the phlegmatic voyagers of the Dolphin, who had
become hardened to the wonders of the sea, could not help
but admire the display.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Upon my word!” cried Stanhope, “I don’t mind possessing
a few of those gems myself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was allowed to rest upon the bottom. Then
Frank brought out some diving suits.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah wanted suits for himself and his men.
Fortunately there were enough, and Frank did not demur.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was arranged that they should go out and gather the
richest of the pearls, and that they should return as soon as
this was done.</p>

<p class='c000'>None of the Dolphins party decided to participate in the
quest.</p>

<p class='c000'>So donning the diving suits Captain Uriah and his men
left the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>It required some little time for them to get accustomed to
the pressure of the water upon their helmets.</p>

<p class='c000'>But they finally overcame this and began to mine for the
pearls.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was slow work and not altogether fruitful.</p>

<p class='c000'>While there were thousands of the pearls upon the bed of
the valley, only a few of them were fit to preserve.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many were imperfect, many crumbled to powder, and
only one in fifty was a perfect and valuable gem.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there were, all the same, many rare, beautiful and
valuable specimens, and these Captain Uriah diligently
searched for.</p>

<p class='c000'>For hours the pearl miners worked, and with much success.
Then suddenly Captain Uriah threw up his arms and
fell in a heap.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney, who was in the pilot-house saw this, and gave a
yell of wild alarm.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='X' class='c009'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <span class='large'>THE STORM.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The Celt knew fully what was the trouble with Captain
Uriah.</p>

<p class='c000'>The pressure upon the helmet had lasted so long that
faintness or syncope had descended upon the luckless man.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was danger that he would die before he could be
got aboard the Dolphin, and Barney realized this.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he yelled:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Misther Frank, for the love av Heaven, cum quick!
Shure there’s the divil to pay! The captain has been overcome,
sor!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank needed no second bidding.</p>

<p class='c000'>Quick as a flash he rushed into the cabin. He sprang into
a diving suit, locked the helmet with a click, set the generator
going, and then sprang into the vestibule.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this was done with great rapidity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he opened the outer door and was in the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The companions of Captain Uriah were staggering from
the same cause.</p>

<p class='c000'>They had been too long subjected to the pressure.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank motioned to them to go aboard the Dolphin instantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he sprang to Captain Uriah’s side.</p>

<p class='c000'>The captain lay partly upon his back, and Frank saw
through the helmet window that his face was horribly distorted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor instantly picked him up bodily and
started for the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>He reached the rail and dragged the overcome man into
the vestibule.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was but a moment’s work to close the door and expel
the water. Then Frank tore away the helmet clasps.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah was like one dead. But Barney had appeared
on the scene instantly with a stimulant.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was administered, and in a few moments all were
overjoyed to see the old captain revive.</p>

<p class='c000'>He opened his eyes and looked about him.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It was a close call, my friend,” said Frank, cheerily,
“but we’ve pulled you through.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah remained in a sitting posture.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What happened?” he asked, feebly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“You were overcome,” said Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Overcome?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“How did that happen?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why, you simply stayed out there in the water too long.
The pressure was too great for a beginner like you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah nodded his head slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Maybe you are right,” he said. “But why didn’t it
affect the others so?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It did,” replied Frank. “They have come aboard also.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Ugh!” exclaimed the captain, struggling to his feet.
“I’ll be all right in a little while, but the pearls——”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Are all safe,” said Frank. “Pomp went out and got
them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was true. While they were resuscitating the captain,
Pomp had gone out and brought in the sack of pearls.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah was soon himself again, and a few hours
later came into Frank’s cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>He poured out a heap of pearls on the table, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Take such of them as you want, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I don’t want any,” replied the young inventor. “I have
no use for them, captain. I am a rich man, anyway. You
must keep them yourself.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you mean that?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But what will repay you?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I ask no pay. I am pleased to have been able to serve
you.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” said Captain Uriah, bringing his hand down
on the table with a thump, “you are the biggest-hearted
man I ever knew. Mark my words, before I die I will repay
you!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do not ever disturb yourself about that,” he said; “it
is all right. But how much longer will we remain here?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Not a minute!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What! Have you finished your work?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Every bit. I have got all the fortune I want right
here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah poured the pearls back into the bag. He
turned to the door. Frank arose, saying:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then if you are all through we will go to the surface.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“That suits me.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The pearl-hunting expedition was over.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Snow was now possessed of what he believed
would make him a very wealthy man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Naturally he was happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he was not selfish. He intended that every member
of his crew should have a fair share.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sent the Dolphin to the surface at once.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as she came up out of the water into daylight there
was revealed to the crew a thrilling state of affairs.</p>

<p class='c000'>A mighty yellow cloud hung from horizon to zenith, and
was sweeping down into the east.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sea was rough and tumbling in long and uneven
billows. A heavy wind went soughing by.</p>

<p class='c000'>A terrible storm was at hand. In fact a literal tornado
threatened.</p>

<p class='c000'>Far to the southward was a white sail.</p>

<p class='c000'>That it was the Belden seemed a certain fact. Captain
Uriah viewed the situation anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I hope they will get down to bare poles before this
blast!” he declared. “It is going to be a fearful one!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is possible we can reach her before the storm comes
on,” said Frank.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I wish we could.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I will try.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank shouted to Barney to put on all speed. The Dolphin
shot away over the waves like a meteor.</p>

<p class='c000'>She was an extremely swift boat in any sea, and the heavy
rollers did not disturb her.</p>

<p class='c000'>On she ran like a bird.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Belden was standing up to the wind with fore and
main topsails so that Captain Uriah’s mind was easy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet he was naturally desirous of reaching the ship before
the storm should strike her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every moment the Dolphin drew nearer. She was even
sighted by the crew of the Belden.</p>

<p class='c000'>The flash and report of a signal gun was heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We shall make it!” cried Captain Uriah, excitedly. “You
shall see!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But even as the words left his lips there came a distant
bellowing sound, a rumble like thunder, and then the storm
burst.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a terribly grand moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>It seemed literally as if all the elements had combined in
one fearful effort to outdo pandemonium.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain fell in sheets; the sea ran mountains high and tossed
the frail Dolphin about like an eggshell.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank saw that it was utterly impossible to reach the
Belden.</p>

<p class='c000'>He knew that the safety of his own boat depended upon
prompt action.</p>

<p class='c000'>So he opened the reservoir lever and let the boat go down.</p>

<p class='c000'>One hundred fathoms beneath the surface the storm was
not felt.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin glided along slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah was not a little worried about his ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Have no fears,” said Frank. “She will outride it, I
know. Then we will find her safe enough.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She will if the lubbers handle her right,” declared the
captain; “but I am afraid they won’t.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At least it did no good to borrow trouble, and realizing
this, the captain became more cheerful.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What do you care?” said Stanhope. “You have a large
fortune in pearls. You can buy many such ships.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus Captain Uriah was consoled.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin cruised aimlessly about in the meanwhile.</p>

<p class='c000'>The barometer yet showed that there was disturbance
above, so those in the cabin of the Dolphin proceeded to
make themselves easy until the storm should pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>And now by way of diversion Barney and Pomp provided
their quota in the line of a musical entertainment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt had a genuine Irish fiddle which he solemnly
asserted had been in his family for ten generations.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shure, it’s dearer to me than the apple av me eye!” he
declared. “Didn’t me ancistors play it in the coort av the
Oirish kings afore iver England got her bould foot on the
neck av ould Oireland!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The amount of melody which Barney could evoke from
that antiquated fiddle was indeed wonderful.</p>

<p class='c000'>He could rattle off jigs, and play and sing ballads by the
score.</p>

<p class='c000'>His voice was a fine baritone, and he sang well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp, on the other hand, was provided with a fund inexhaustible
of negro melodies savoring of plantation days.</p>

<p class='c000'>He played the banjo and the bones, danced a clog dance
and could sing in a full tenor voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>They played and sang to the company until completely
exhausted. Captain Uriah’s sailors were particularly delighted
and cheered them roundly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus several hours were passed in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank finally went to the barometer and cried, joyfully:</p>

<p class='c000'>“The storm is over!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” cried Captain Uriah. “Let us go to the surface.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it best?” asked the young inventor.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Darkness has come on.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This was true. With the going down of the storm had
come night.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those on board the Dolphin under the sea had no means
of knowing this save by the chronometer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah was thoughtful a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think we had better, Frank.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right,” agreed the young inventor. “It shall be so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>He touched the lever and the boat sprang upward.</p>

<p class='c000'>Up, up, she went, and rose from the depths into the night
air. Above was the moonlit sky. All around them was the
storm-swept but calm sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Instinctively all looked for the lights of the Belden.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even to the horizon they were not to be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ship must have been driven many miles from her
course.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here was a predicament. Captain Uriah was disposed to
regard it seriously, but Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I should not worry at all. There is not the slightest
doubt but that she will return here. It is her best and only
course.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Certainly it seems so!” agreed the captain; “that is if
those lubbers will have the good sense.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But will they not? Have you not a competent crew?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I think so.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Then do not worry any more about it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All night long the Dolphin rocked upon the swelling
but peaceful sea. All on board were very tired.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney kept watch the first of the night, and Pomp the
latter part. At length daylight came once more.</p>

<p class='c000'>And as the sun rose up out of the sea it revealed a surprising
spectacle.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XI' class='c009'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <span class='large'>THE ISLAND—ON A REEF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>All night long Pomp had observed to leeward what he had
regarded as a huge cloud bank.</p>

<p class='c000'>But now, as daylight cleared away the mists, it was revealed
as a very startling spectacle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The cloud bank was extremely tangible, and was, in fact,
nothing more nor less than a line of coast.</p>

<p class='c000'>It extended for many leagues to the westward, and its
rugged, high cliffs frowned most forbiddingly upon the
heaving crests of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly!” gasped the astonished darky, “dat jes’ beat me
all out. I jes’ beliebe dat am an island.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky rubbed his eyes to make sure that his vision
was clear. Then he muttered:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’se gwine fo’ to call Marse Frank at once. It am
drefful funny!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The darky at once went rushing down into the cabin,
shouting:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Marse Frank, fo’ de lan’ ob massy sakes, cum quick!
Wha’ yo’ fink we hab cum to, sah? It am lan’, sah, jes’ so
suah as yo’ am bo’n!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, somewhat startled, sprang up and rushed out on
deck.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw the state of affairs at once. Pomp was right.</p>

<p class='c000'>“An island!” he gasped. “It is not on any chart. How
very queer!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Pomp’s cry had alarmed others of the crew. These now
came rushing out to view the strange spectacle.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a forbidding coast, with rocky shores and high
bluffs, against which the waves broke pitilessly.</p>

<p class='c000'>So far as could be seen it furnished no harbor or refuge of
any kind for a vessel. What its vegetable or animal life
was it was not easy to guess.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few waving pines were seen upon the cliffs, a few
stunted trees of the deciduous order also.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well,” muttered Captain Uriah in a mystified way,
“where are we? I never remember of a charted isle in these
seas!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We have then made a discovery,” said Frank. “Perhaps
an important one. Who knows?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Shall you go ashore?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“I have a desire to; but first let us find the ship.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Let us christen the isle as long as we are the discoverers!”
cried Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“All right!” agreed Frank and the captain in one breath.
“What shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“We will call it Pearl Island, as it was discovered so near
the valley of pearls.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good!” cried Captain Uriah. “You have hit it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, I wudn’t moind thryin a bit av a thramp on it
mesilf,” said Barney. “Shure, me legs are sthiff from the
lack av exercise on shore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, dat’s right, I’ish!” cried Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Rest easy,” said Frank. “You shall have the chance.
But first I must ease Captain Snow’s mind.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By no means,” protested the captain. “If it is the disposition
of the party, we will visit the isle first.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“No,” cried Stanhope; “it is more important that we
should find the Belden first of all.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Powerful glasses were brought into requisition, and the
sea was scanned closely, but not the slightest speck could be
seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was reckoned that the Belden would be blown to the
northeast, so it was decided to pursue the quest in that direction.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin headed that way, which would carry it past
the point of the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had just got under headway and was leaving the isle
to the eastward when a terrible thing occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a sudden terrible jar, a jolt and a crash.
Everybody on board was thrown from his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was at a standstill.</p>

<p class='c000'>It needed no further explanation to tell Frank Reade,
Jr., the truth. He gained his feet and rushed to the rail.</p>

<p class='c000'>The submarine boat had struck full head upon a reef!</p>

<p class='c000'>She lay with the waves breaking over her bow.</p>

<p class='c000'>How badly she was stove could not be seen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Horror was upon the features of all as this dreadful realization
burst upon them.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My goodness!” cried Stanhope, in awful despair. “We
are lost! This is the end of the Dolphin!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“A sunken reef!” groaned Captain Uriah.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., said nothing. He was very pale but
quite cool.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin rocked and groaned some as the waves lifted
her, and it was evident that the heavy sea would be most
disastrous.</p>

<p class='c000'>She must be got off at once or the result would indeed be
serious.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank studied her position for some moments, and then
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bring out the diving suit, Barney. I must make an
examination.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you think she can be got off, Frank?” asked Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot say yet.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney hastened to bring up the diving suit. Frank put
it on and then tied a rope around his waist.</p>

<p class='c000'>By means of this he was lowered down into the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the bottom he went, and at a point where he could see
the position of the Dolphin well.</p>

<p class='c000'>He carried a strong electric light in his helmet. With
this he could see all objects about quite plain.</p>

<p class='c000'>He carefully examined the position of the boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>He saw that she rested upon a section of the jagged reef.
The sharp rocks had punctured her outer shell near the
bow, and she was held as in a vise.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank at once saw the futility of trying to draw her off.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even if the power was at hand and could be employed,
it would tear a terrible hole in her.</p>

<p class='c000'>It certainly looked as if the Dolphin was a total loss.</p>

<p class='c000'>A more disheartening reflection than this can hardly be
imagined. Frank was quite discouraged.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, he would not give up hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>He continued his examination of the craft, and finally
reached the conclusion that there was only one way in which
the Dolphin could be saved.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a chance out of a hundred, but Frank decided to
take it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The section of reef had many cavities.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the largest of these Frank believed a torpedo could be
placed and exploded.</p>

<p class='c000'>This would tear the reef to pieces and doubtless dislodge
the Dolphin; but, of course, there was the chance of blowing
a hole in her and instantly sinking her.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even if she were safely dislodged, it was possible that
the hole in her outer hull would cause her to take so much
water that she would sink.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the young inventor was determined to act, and accordingly
sent up the signal to be drawn up.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a few moments he was again on the deck of the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Well, Frank, how is it?” cried Stanhope. “Are we lost
or not?”</p>

<p class='c000'>The young inventor shook his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I cannot say yet,” he declared.</p>

<p class='c000'>He sent Barney into the cabin for a torpedo. A wire was
attached to it, and once more Frank put on his helmet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Again he went over the rail and down under the keel of
the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>He selected what he considered a suitable spot, and placed
the torpedo in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he signaled to be drawn up again, and soon was once
more on the deck of the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>Removing his helmet, Frank said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I am going to explode a torpedo under this boat. It
may dislodge her and it may sink her. If any of you fear
the consequences you may go ashore.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Is it the best thing to do, Frank?” asked Stanhope, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It is our only chance.”</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a moment of silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah finally said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I believe in sticking to the ship!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“So do I!” cried Stanhope.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s mesilf will niver go ashore,” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I reckon if de ole boat go down I jes’ go down wif it,”
averred Pomp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The sailors from the Belden were of the same opinion.
So Frank at once made connection with the dynamo.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the explosion would be under the bow, it was deemed
best to get as far away as possible.</p>

<p class='c000'>So all went to the stern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank waited for a moment when the boat was steady in
its rocking. Then he pressed the electric key.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a sudden shock, a muffled roar, and the Dolphin
heaved and pitched violently.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a great column of water shot up abaft her bows,
and she was perceptibly lifted and hurled back.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hurrah!” cried Frank, with the wildest of joy. “She
is off the reef!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The others gave a great cheer. It was too good to believe.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it was the truth, just the same. The Dolphin was off
the reef.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank sprang into the pilot-house and pressed the motive
lever. She backed away, and answered her helm readily.</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment the spirits of the voyagers were indeed
high.</p>

<p class='c000'>But as a thrilling event proved, this was premature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly the Dolphin began to rock strangely, and a dull
gurgling was heard under her bow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank ran to the companionway that led down into her
hold, and listened intently.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he turned about his face was deadly pale.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My God!” he gasped. “The Dolphin is doomed!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“What!” cried Stanhope, in alarm. “Is she sinking?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“She is making water fast!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Consternation most profound seized the voyagers.</p>

<p class='c000'>What did the future hold for them?</p>

<p class='c000'>Luckily they were near land. But to be cast away upon a
desert isle in this part of the world was by no means a
pleasant thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin was sinking beyond a doubt.</p>

<p class='c000'>“What shall we do?” cried Stanhope. “Shall we leave
her, Frank?”</p>

<p class='c000'>For one swift moment the young inventor had thought
of this. But now another plan came to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the boat sank in that spot he knew she could never be
redeemed. He looked toward the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a little sandy strip of beach in a small cove.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank instantly seized the wheel. She would yet answer
this, and he pressed the motive lever.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dolphin shot forward, headed directly for the island
shore.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <span class='large'>CASTAWAY—RESCUE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Straight for the sandy beach she ran full speed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, intended to beach her. This was not a difficult
thing.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her bows were not sharp and capable of gliding over a
smooth surface. She struck the sand with a high-pitched
bow.</p>

<p class='c000'>This drove her half through the surf. The shock was tremendous.</p>

<p class='c000'>There upon the sand lay the submarine boat. It was indeed
a disheartening sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every heavy breaker washed her stern and flooded her
rails. A high sea would break over her.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her end was assured.</p>

<p class='c000'>She could never be floated from that position.</p>

<p class='c000'>All that could be done was to get all portable and valuable
effects ashore.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was easy to leap from the bow down into the surf and
wade ashore. Several did this.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a line was established, and the process of getting the
effects ashore was begun.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a short while there was a great heap of stuff on the
island beach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Provisions were there in plenty, and all portable effects
that would be useful.</p>

<p class='c000'>For hours the castaways labored thus. But ever and anon
they cast anxious glances to the horizon line to look for some
sign of the Belden.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it did not appear.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was their only hope, that they might be able to sight
and hail the Yankee brig.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was indeed a sad sight to see the Dolphin in its present
position.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such a triumph of inventive genius as it was, and to think
that it must now be given up to decay!</p>

<p class='c000'>It did seem altogether wrong. But there was no help for
it. Perhaps the most philosophical of all was Frank Reade,
Jr., himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Never mind,” he said. “I will get up something to beat
her.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“You will do well if you do, Frank,” Stanhope said.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the young inventor only smiled. He knew his power
well.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was now in order for the castaways to make themselves
as comfortable as possible and then explore the island.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was a cavity in the cliffs which was sheltered from
the elements, and into it Frank caused all the provisions
to be carried.</p>

<p class='c000'>A wide sheet of canvas kept off the raw east wind. Blankets
were spread and couches made, and the castaways had
soon made themselves quite comfortable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nightfall came, and Captain Uriah walked out on the
beach sniffing the air, and said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“I tell you, mates, we’re going to have a blow within
twelve hours.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Do you believe it, captain?” asked Frank, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All eyes were at once turned upon the Dolphin.</p>

<p class='c000'>There she lay, washed by the swell.</p>

<p class='c000'>A beautiful wreck she was. It was like bidding farewell
to a dying friend.</p>

<p class='c000'>For all knew that the first storm would relegate the Dolphin
to oblivion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind certainly was shifting into the northeast, and it
looked as if Captain Uriah’s prediction would come true.</p>

<p class='c000'>All retired early that night.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was almost a sleepless night for most of the party. But
toward morning a distant booming sound was heard.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rain pattered upon the canvas which hung over the entrance
to the cavity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storm had come.</p>

<p class='c000'>The wind quickly freshened into a gale. It was barely
daylight, but all arose and went out on shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waves were growing mountain-like every moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>And there they broke over the wreck of the Dolphin with
thundering force.</p>

<p class='c000'>They crashed down upon the steel decks, and raged and
seethed and hissed furiously about their prey.</p>

<p class='c000'>But all to no purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The keen nose of the Dolphin, like that of some stranded
monster of the sea, still held its position.</p>

<p class='c000'>But before noon the incessant waves had carried away
a portion of the port bulwarks.</p>

<p class='c000'>This was the beginning of the end. From that moment
the Dolphin broke up rapidly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon little was left of her but a few of her steel ribs;
much of the wreck was washed high upon the sands.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a sad party which sat on the storm-driven shore
and watched the miserable demise of the famous submarine
boat.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It’s too bad!” was all Stanhope could say.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had carefully preserved the metal case containing the
confession just the same.</p>

<p class='c000'>It would no doubt be a long time, however, before he could
make use of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Valentine Tucker must languish behind bars for some
time yet.</p>

<p class='c000'>Captain Uriah had taken good care to preserve his precious
bag of pearls.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he never left the isle they would of course be of little
value to him. But he hoped to do this.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I’ll save them, anyway,” he had declared. “If I ever
get back to civilization the money will come handy.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney and Pomp were extremely disconsolate.</p>

<p class='c000'>The loss of the Dolphin was to them a most serious
matter.</p>

<p class='c000'>“I done tell yo’ we am gwine fo’ to starve on dis yere
old island!” affirmed Pomp, confidently. “I done feel it
in mah bones.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s an awful place to be found dead in!” declared
Barney, moodily. “Be me sowl! I’m that lonesome I
cud cry me eyes out!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Two days slipped by.</p>

<p class='c000'>The storm had drifted away to the eastward and was over.
The sun once more shone out clear and bright.</p>

<p class='c000'>This revived somewhat the drooping spirits of all, and
Captain Uriah said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Suppose we set a signal flag for the Belden to see?”</p>

<p class='c000'>It was certainly not a bad idea.</p>

<p class='c000'>So a long pole was procured and upon it was nailed a
huge square of canvas. This could be seen far out to sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then faggots were collected with which to keep a beacon
light at night.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the Belden should come anywhere within range of the
island it could not fail to be attracted.</p>

<p class='c000'>But what Captain Uriah feared was that it would continue
to cruise in the same limited area, and then after a
disheartening period give up the quest and go back to San
Francisco.</p>

<p class='c000'>In that case they would be indeed badly off. Abandoned
on a desert isle! What a fearful fate!</p>

<p class='c000'>For days they climbed the cliffs and gazed seaward, hour
after hour, in quest of the welcome sail.</p>

<p class='c000'>But it came not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then a sort of grim despair began to settle down upon all.
Some of them became taciturn and morose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finally one day Barney and Pomp came to Frank. Pomp
said:</p>

<p class='c000'>“If yo’ please, sah, we am berry low on provisions. I
done fink we hab got to fin’ somefin’ else to eat right away,
sah.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Bejabers, it’s afther goin’ huntin’ we’ll be,” said Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Right,” said Frank. “We will organize a party at once.
Bring out the guns, Barney.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt was only too ready to obey.</p>

<p class='c000'>Anything which developed excitement was welcome, and
he and Pomp were at once in gay feather.</p>

<p class='c000'>They soon procured the guns and some ammunition,
and the start was made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank, with Barney and Pomp, as the most experienced
hunters, led the way.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the first exploration of the island that had been
made.</p>

<p class='c000'>Straight for the interior Frank pushed.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they went on, the land began to rise, and grew very
rocky.</p>

<p class='c000'>At length an elevation was reached from which a view
of the whole island could be had.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was seen to be completely barren and unproductive.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no natural fruit of any kind—not even a berry
or a plum.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was a desolate waste.</p>

<p class='c000'>Truly, to be forced to confront the fact that they must
live the rest of their lives upon this limited bit of barrenness
was hard indeed.</p>

<p class='c000'>“It makes a man feel blue,” said Stanhope. “I almost
wish I had stayed at home.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“By my honor! I wish I had!” agreed Captain Uriah.
“Poverty at home is better than riches here.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“But we are here,” said Frank Reade, Jr., pluckily, “And
we must make the best of it.”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Oh, certainly,” agreed Stanhope, readily. “I am not
squealing, Frank. I took my chances and now I’ll stand by
’em.”</p>

<p class='c000'>At this moment the report of a gun was heard at the
edge of a small lake near.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney had fired into a flock of ducks and had killed
three. Presently he came up with his prize.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, it’s a foine shot I med!” he cried. “I thried
for one, and, be me sowl! hit tree av thim. Divil a bit
betther cud any wan ask!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Everybody laughed at this, and then all separated for the
hunt.</p>

<p class='c000'>There was no game upon the isle but birds. Beasts or
animals of even the smallest order did not exist.</p>

<p class='c000'>But ducks and geese were quite plenty.</p>

<p class='c000'>A good bag of these was secured, and then the party returned
to the camp under the cliff.</p>

<p class='c000'>A fire was built and the game roasted. A hearty meal
was partaken of, and then all sat down in a circle about the
fire and told stories and cracked jokes until midnight.</p>

<p class='c000'>Truly the life upon the isle was not without its bright side.
How long it would last, however, it was not easy to say.</p>

<p class='c000'>Several days more passed, and nothing worthy of note
occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Barney strolling along the beach, made a surprising
discovery. He saw imbedded in the sand what looked
like an iron capstan.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began to dig around it, and found that it was truly a
capstan; also he traced in the sand the outlines of a vessel’s
hull.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was no doubt the wreck of a ship which had come
ashore here, and sank gradually beneath the level, owing to
some quicksand formation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Barney was busy with his examination, and was about to
shout to his friends, when a thrilling thing occurred.</p>

<p class='c000'>Suddenly he felt the sand give way and sink downward.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='XIII' class='c009'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <span class='large'>THE END.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Down out of sight Barney went like a flash.</p>

<p class='c000'>As it happened, Pomp saw him disappear and set up a
yell for help.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Golly, de I’ishman am gone!” he screamed. “Come
quick, Marse Frank! Cum everybody! He am done gone!”</p>

<p class='c000'>Down Barney fell for several feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>When he picked himself up he was astonished.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was in the cabin of a ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sand and debris were heaped upon the floor, and there
was little left to show that it was really the cabin of a
ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>But such it was.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Celt picked himself up to hear a voice above:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Hi dar! Am yo’ kilt, I’ish?”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Divil a bit!” roared the Celt. “Cum down yersilf, naygur!”</p>

<p class='c000'>But Pomp was satisfied with gazing down into the place.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Fo’ de lan’s sake!” he gasped; “it am de cabin ob a
ship!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Begorra, that’s what it is!” cried Barney.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Upon my word it is, Frank!” said Stanhope, who, with
the young inventor, had come up just at that moment. “It
is a sunken vessel!”</p>

<p class='c000'>“Deeply sunk in the shoals!” said Frank. “Truly that
is very odd.”</p>

<p class='c000'>All crowded about the cavity in the sand.</p>

<p class='c000'>What was the name of the ship, and how long it had been
in this position it was not easy to guess.</p>

<p class='c000'>But from what could be seen of the woodwork and the
shape of the hull, it was evidently of a very antique pattern.</p>

<p class='c000'>Doubtless it had lain there buried for a hundred years or
more. What was the fate of its crew would never be known.
Oblivion covered all.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thoughts of this kind were surging through the mind of
Frank Reade, Jr., as he stood there.</p>

<p class='c000'>Who should say that they would not share the same fate
as those castaways, and perhaps find a lonely grave upon the
desert isle?</p>

<p class='c000'>Some time strangers might come and ruminate upon
their fate in precisely the same manner. It was a curious
thing to ponder on.</p>

<p class='c000'>But even as they stood thus engrossed around a headland
of the isle there swung the hull of a ship.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her sails filled lazily in the breeze as she rounded to an
anchorage. The rattle of her chain was the first thing to apprise
the castaways of her presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Great Jericho!” gasped Captain Uriah.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he yelled at the top of his lungs:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Alloy! the Belden!”</p>

<p class='c000'>The scene which follows baffles description. Barney
scrambled out of his hole.</p>

<p class='c000'>All rushed down to the water’s edge insane with joy and
excitement. A boat put out from the Belden.</p>

<p class='c000'>Half an hour later all their effects were safe on board the
big brig.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great voyage of the Dolphin was ended. In one sense
it was a great success.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief ends had been gained. The loss of the Dolphin
was the dampening feature.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two months later the Belden arrived in San Francisco
harbor. A thankful crew disembarked.</p>

<p class='c000'>Frank Reade, Jr., Barney and Pomp returned at once to
Readestown, but before they left the Golden Gate, Valentine
Tucker was set free and rejoined his happy family.</p>

<p class='c000'>George Stanhope went back to Philadelphia, his home,
happy as could be. As for Captain Uriah, his valuable
pearls netted him a vast fortune. And so we write.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
